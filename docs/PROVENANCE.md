# Project Quorum, Provenance Trail

Records every material (state-changing) action taken while preparing the account and
repo. Read-only audit calls are summarized, not exhaustively logged.
**Secrets (access keys, tokens) are never recorded in this file.**

- **AWS account:** `<account redacted; see docs/private>` (IAM principal `<deploy-user>`)
- **Default region:** `us-east-1` · **Project regions:** `us-east-1`, `us-east-2` (active), `us-west-2` (witness)
- **AWS access:** profile `h0` (`AWS_PROFILE=h0`)

---

## 2026-06-07, Phase 0: Local environment

| Action | Command / detail | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Verified toolchain | `git 2.43.0`, `aws-cli 2.34.63` (v2), `terraform 1.15.5`, `node 24.14.0`, `gh 2.88.1` (authed: `hocmemini`) | Confirm prerequisites |
| Installed pnpm `11.5.2` | `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate` | Workspace package manager (was missing) |
| Configured AWS profile `h0` | `aws configure set …` → `~/.aws/credentials` (secret **not** recorded) | Programmatic access |
| Set shell default profile | appended `export AWS_PROFILE=h0` to `~/.bashrc` (profile name only, no secret) | Make `h0` active by default |
| Verified identity | `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile h0` → account `<account redacted; see docs/private>`, user `<deploy-user>` | Confirm access works |

**Security note, credential file perms:** `~/.aws` is a symlink to
`/mnt/c/Users/<user>/.aws` (Windows NTFS surfaced through WSL `v9fs`). Linux `chmod 600`
has **no effect** there; files display `rwxrwxrwx`. Real protection is the Windows ACL on
the user profile (`C:\Users\<user>`), restricted to this user + Administrators by default.
Left as-is per intentional Windows/WSL credential sharing. **Action item: rotate the
`h0` access key after this session**, it was pasted into the chat transcript.

---

## 2026-06-07, Phase 1: Account audit (read-only), PARTIALLY DEFERRED

- **AWS auth not yet propagated.** STS recognizes the fresh `h0` key, but EC2/IAM/Cost
  Explorer/etc. return `AuthFailure` / `InvalidClientTokenId`. A 20-minute background poll
  (`describe-regions`) did not clear it, consistent with the up-to-24h reactivation window.
  **Phase 1 AWS data collection is deferred** (see [AUDIT.md](./private/AUDIT.md) for resume commands).
- **Cost Explorer:** 2 calls attempted, both rejected on auth → **$0 billed** (CE charges
  only for processed requests).
- **DSQL multi-region peering: verified via current AWS docs**, `us-east-1` + `us-east-2`
  peered with `us-west-2` witness is the canonical documented configuration. Details + sources
  in AUDIT.md §3.
- **Deliverable ready:** `scripts/audit-sweep.sh` (read-only sweep).

---

## 2026-06-07, Phase 4: Repo & monorepo scaffold

| Action | Command / detail | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `git init` on `main` | `git init -b main` | Canonical project monorepo |
| Local git identity | name `hocmemini`, email → GitHub noreply | Author commits |
| Scaffold + tooling | pnpm workspaces; strict TS (`tsc` clean); Biome; Vitest; tsx; `packages/db` Kysely+pg client + one-DDL-per-txn migration runner | Per spec |
| Validated toolchain | `pnpm install` (+esbuild build), `biome check`, `tsc --noEmit`, `vitest`, all green | Readiness |
| Installed gitleaks `8.30.1` | `scripts/install-gitleaks.sh` → `~/.local/bin` | Secret scanning |
| Enabled pre-commit hook | `core.hooksPath=.githooks` (gitleaks `git --staged`) | Block secrets from history |
| 5 granular commits | scaffold → tooling → docs → hooks → audit-sweep; each scanned clean | Provenance |
| Created **private** GitHub repo | `gh repo create quorum --private` → `github.com/hocmemini/quorum` | Remote |
| Re-authored 5 commits | `git filter-branch` author+committer email → noreply | **Explicit user approval** (GitHub blocked pushing a private email); content/messages/order unchanged; old gmail commits pruned locally |
| Pushed `main` | `git push -u origin main` | Publish (private) |

**Note on the re-author.** The standing rule is "never rewrite history." This single
email-only rewrite of the 5 **unpushed** setup commits (identical content, messages, order)
was performed **only after explicit user approval**, to keep a private email out of a repo
that goes public later. No work-provenance was lost; history is append-only from here.

## 2026-06-07, AWS Free Tier activity credits pass, FULLY DEFERRED

Attempted the $100 (5 × $20) Free Tier activity-credit pass. **AWS auth had regressed to
full failure**, by 18:58 UTC even `sts get-caller-identity` returned `InvalidClientTokenId`
(earlier in the day STS worked while other services didn't). Stored `h0` key unchanged, no
env-cred interference, credentials file intact → server-side auth state (billing/verification
window), not fixable locally. **No resources were created or destroyed. Nothing billed.**

| # | Activity | Method (when unblocked) | Credit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AWS Budgets | CLI `create-budget` ($20 monthly cost), permanent | $20 | DEFERRED (auth) |
| 2 | Lambda web app | inline `nodejs22.x` fn + function URL (auth NONE), curl 200, delete | $20 | DEFERRED (auth) |
| 3 | EC2 instance | `t3.micro` from AL2023 SSM AMI, run → terminate | $20 | DEFERRED (auth) |
| 4 | RDS database | PostgreSQL `db.t4g.micro` 20 GB gp3, create → delete | $20 | DEFERRED (auth) |
| 5 | Bedrock | `bedrock-runtime converse` (Nova Micro) + manual console fallback | $20 | DEFERRED (auth) |
| | **Total** | | **$100** | **0 claimed** |

Runnable commands for all five (plus carried-over prep) are consolidated in
[REMAINING.md](./REMAINING.md) for a single future pass.

## 2026-06-07, WP-0 failover spike build (local; apply + run deferred)

Built the WP-0 gate spike. All local work is complete, validated, and pushed; only
`terraform apply` and the live claims run remain (AWS auth deferred).

| Action | Detail | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Verified DSQL Terraform schema | `terraform providers schema -json` on `hashicorp/aws` v6.49 → `aws_dsql_cluster` + `aws_dsql_cluster_peering` (a guessed `aws_dsql_cluster_multi_region` does **not** exist) | "do not guess" |
| Verified token-signer API | installed `@aws-sdk/dsql-signer` v3.1063.0 → `DsqlSigner.getDbConnect[Admin]AuthToken()` | "do not guess" |
| Reconfirmed region trio | AWS docs: us-east-1 + us-east-2 + us-west-2 (witness) is the documented US set | RISK-6 |
| Wrote `infra/spike` | two peered `aws_dsql_cluster` + witness + IAM connect policy; `terraform fmt/init/validate` pass (no apply) | provision infra |
| Wrote `packages/spike-failover` | pg failover client (token-per-connect, transparent failover, OCC on 40001), one-DDL-per-txn migration, C1/C2/C3 claims + latency, report + teardown scripts | the spike |
| Validated locally | strict `tsc` clean · Biome clean · **10/10 vitest** unit tests pass (failover + OCC, no AWS) | confidence before apply |
| Moved SOW → `docs/SOW.md` | per the SOW's own convention; ignored `*:Zone.Identifier` artifacts | provenance |

**Remaining for WP-0 (needs auth):** `terraform -chdir=infra/spike apply` → wire `.env` →
`pnpm --filter @quorum/spike-failover report` → commit `SPIKE_RESULTS.md` → `scripts/teardown-spike.sh`.

## 2026-06-07, Public-safe pass + spike hardening (DEC-007, DEC-008)

| Action | Detail | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Moved `docs/AUDIT.md` → `docs/private/AUDIT.md` (gitignored) | untracked from HEAD; account id, IAM names, inventory, spend leave the public tree | DEC-008 |
| Redacted account-specific identifiers | account id + IAM username → placeholders in CLAUDE.md, this file, REMAINING.md, infra/bootstrap | DEC-008 |
| Spike IAM made public-safe | `connect_user` default `""` + `count` guard; example uses a placeholder (real value in gitignored tfvars) | DEC-008 |
| Added real-hang failover test | `scripts/blackhole.sh` (iptables) + `pnpm … smoke` (`failover-smoke.ts`) | exercise timeout/failover under a true TCP hang before NACL/FIS |
| Re-validated | `terraform validate`, strict `tsc`, Biome, 10/10 vitest, all green | confidence |

_History note: earlier commits already contain pre-redaction identifiers; per the no-rewrite rule, history is unchanged. The public flip is a redaction review or a clean mirror (DEC-008)._

## 2026-06-07, Auth unblocked + Phase 1 audit (profile misdiagnosis corrected)

**Correction to earlier entries.** The intermittent `InvalidClientTokenId` / `AuthFailure`
attributed above to a "billing/verification window" was a **misdiagnosis**. Root cause: the
non-interactive shell never had `AWS_PROFILE=h0` (it lives only in `~/.bashrc`, which
non-interactive shells don't source) and `--profile h0` was passed inconsistently, so service
calls fell back to a stale `default` profile with a dead key. With `AWS_PROFILE=h0` set, every
service (STS, EC2, IAM, S3, DSQL) works and is stable; the `h0` account/key were fine throughout.
**Lesson: always `export AWS_PROFILE=h0` (or pass `--profile h0`) in automation here.**

Phase 1 audit then ran read-only (`AWS_PROFILE=h0`). Detailed findings in `docs/private/AUDIT.md`.
Public-safe summary:

- Clean, near-empty account. Root: no access keys, MFA enabled. 1 IAM user (deploy user; no MFA),
  3 roles, none with `AdministratorAccess` or wildcard trust. 0 customer-managed policies. 0 S3 buckets.
- **Account-level S3 Block Public Access is not set** → enable in Phase 3.
- DSQL available in `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-2` (no clusters yet).
- Cost Explorer has no data yet (new account); ~$0 spend.
- Resource sweep (`scripts/audit-sweep.sh`) across all enabled regions → KILL/KEEP in AUDIT.md.

## 2026-06-07, Governance pass (DEC-009 + decision protocol)

File/git only; no AWS calls. Added **DEC-009** (Vercel CLI-deploy-only, no Git connection) to
SOW §11.1 + a Change Log line. Promoted the decision-log convention into `CLAUDE.md` ("Decision
governance" + "Vercel deployment policy" sections). Added `scripts/preflight-vercel.sh`, a
POSIX guard that fails loudly if `vercel whoami` ≠ `VERCEL_EXPECTED_ACCOUNT` (or no session /
unset var), since this machine may hold a session for a different production Vercel account.
Documented `VERCEL_EXPECTED_ACCOUNT` in `.env.example` (value in gitignored `.env.local`).
Confirmed `docs/private/AUDIT.md` is gitignored and untracked (DEC-008 move stands).

## 2026-06-07, WP-0 failover spike: APPLIED + PASSED (gate = GO)

`terraform -chdir=infra/spike apply` created the multi-region DSQL pair (us-east-1 + us-east-2,
witness us-west-2) + IAM connect policy (6 resources; clusters ACTIVE and peered in ~2m13s).
`pnpm --filter @quorum/spike-failover report` ran the migration (`0001_spike_event.sql`,
`CREATE TABLE` + `CREATE INDEX ASYNC`, one DDL per transaction) then the three claims,
**all PASS**:

- **C1 strong consistency:** wrote via us-east-1, read via us-east-2 with no polling.
- **C2 active-active:** 50 concurrent dual-region writes; both regions return the identical complete set (51 events), conflicts retried.
- **C3 survival:** us-east-1 marked unreachable → wrote/read via us-east-2; us-east-1 returned all outage writes after restore.
- **Cross-region write latency:** median 754 ms, p99 994 ms (n=50).

Results: `packages/spike-failover/SPIKE_RESULTS.md`. **WP-0 gate = GO**, the DSQL multi-region
active-active thesis is validated; the code carries forward (DEC-006). Clusters left running for
now (DSQL scales to zero when idle); `scripts/teardown-spike.sh` tears them down.

## 2026-06-07, WP-0 closeout: real-hang failover validated + spike torn down

- **Blackhole smoke (real network hang).** Fixed the local blackhole to pin the endpoint
  hostname → unrouted IP (`198.51.100.1`) via `/etc/hosts`, the iptables single-IP DROP was
  insufficient because DSQL endpoints resolve to multiple/rotating IPs (smoke was still served
  by the "blackholed" region). Re-run with us-east-1 blackholed: read+write **failed over to
  us-east-2** after the ~4 s connect timeout (4504 ms / 4159 ms). Confirms the real network-hang
  failover path (C3's in-process flag only exercised the logic).
- **Teardown.** `scripts/teardown-spike.sh` → `terraform destroy` removed all **6 resources**
  (2 clusters + 2 peerings + IAM policy + attachment); verification sweep shows no clusters in
  any region and no spike IAM policy. **Zero idle cost.** Spike code + Terraform retained for WP-8.

## Consolidated remaining work → [REMAINING.md](./REMAINING.md)

All blocked on the AWS billing/verification window (auth). When `aws ec2 describe-regions`
succeeds, run REMAINING.md top-to-bottom:

- **A.** Free Tier credits (5 activities above), ephemeral; all destroyed in-pass **except the budget**.
- **B1.** Phase 1 audit (CE spend, `scripts/audit-sweep.sh`, IAM hygiene, DSQL account check) → KILL/KEEP lists → **stop for line-item approval**.
- **B2.** Phase 2 cleanup, gated on B1 approval.
- **B3.** Phase 3 scaffold (account S3 BPA, tfstate bucket, SNS, budget, billing alarm), gated on approval + **needs your alert email**.
- **C.** WP-0 Aurora DSQL failover spike → `packages/spike-failover`.

**Open user action items:** rotate the `h0` key when done (it was pasted in chat); provide an
alert email for Phase 3; line-item approve the KILL LIST once B1 produces it.

## 2026-06-07: Editorial and hygiene pass (WP-12, MODE=pre-submission)

Ran the WP-12 editorial gate. Report:
[EDITORIAL-2026-06-07-pre-submission.md](./EDITORIAL-2026-06-07-pre-submission.md). Mechanical
fixes (commit `chore(editorial): pre-submission hygiene pass`): ASCII-folded 22 code/config/TF
files; voice pass removed em-dashes from all markdown; redacted a local OS username path in this
file; removed `DSQL_ENDPOINT_WITNESS` from `.env.example` (a witness region has no endpoint);
added markdownlint-cli2, knip, cspell tooling, configs, and lint scripts. Verified: no invisibles
or bidi; no identifiers or secrets outside `docs/private`; docs/private, .vercel, tfstate, .env
untracked; gitleaks full history (29 commits) clean; no TODO/FIXME; knip no dead code; terraform
fmt and validate clean; `private:true` on all 6 packages; DEC-001..012 sequential. Fresh-clone
gate PASS (install, check, typecheck, 27 tests, build from scratch). Result PASS, with 2 minor
review items (the word "additionally" in the provided WP-12 text; `.env.example` placeholder
reconciliation at WP-6/7). cspell substituted for typos (no npm package).
